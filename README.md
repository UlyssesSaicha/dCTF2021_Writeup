# dCTF2021_Writeup

This is just my general thoughts on my first ever CTF. If you just want the solution, go to the specific writeup for each challenge.

As mentioned, I had never attended a live CTF, so I did not know what to expect. I found this one on CTFTime aimed at begginers, so why not?

I set out the entire weekend for it, and started as soon as the CTF went live.


There were some connection issues, but other than that, it was a smooth start.

I was in a solo team, but quickly found 3 people to team up with:

`TobjasR#3519`
`Edward#5238`
and
`gogo#1923`

Funnily enough, the team was named (drumrolls please):

That gave me a good giggle...


Overall, I provided most of the points:

With our breakdown being:

Now, I don't know who was the one trying to input any flag... Why so many fails? Probably someone on the team raged xD.


We didn't converse much at all, apart from the first and final days.

The main problems for the team were that Gogo and Edward did not have a good microphone, and were almost impossible to understand.

Other than that, trying to compete in an event with people you have never talked to is also very difficult.

## Unexpected circumstances

The second day of the event (Saturday)) was the worst for me. I barely competed apart from one or two challenges. My problem was that I woke up with my back KILLING me. I could not be in any position without my back starting to hurt after 15 seconds. Sorry team!


### EXTRA

By going to https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity

You can see all your search history, and even filter by dates!

So I extracted all the data from the website and cleaned it:

Which results in a total of `434` searches for the entire weekend!

I didn't do anything else other than watch some twitch streams on the weekend, so I'd say that's roughly all from the ctf.

Additionally, I visted a total of `483` pages:

### EXTRA

In one of the challenges, we are given this image, fri.png:

I couldn't figure it out, so I did a reverse image search, and found a blog post from what I believe is one of the admins of the CTF:

It has nothing to do with the solution, but I thought it was interesting.


## Notes

All the writeups that I wrote are the ones which I completed and found something interesting to write. Some are missing, and a lot of the other challenges I just didn't complete. 

Thank you for reading!
