# Leak Spin and DevOps vs SecOps


These two challenges went hand in hand.

There was no info provided on any of them, other than two short descriptions that I can no longer access since I am writing this after the ctf ended.


However, I found out about it while investigating challenge Injection:

Huh.. a github page...

And that was it for leak spin:

# DevOps vs SecOps

This one was also in their github page:

However it was more concealed...

Basically, you had to go to the devops branch:

Then actions:

And navigate through the `Create ctfd.yml` and get the flag:
